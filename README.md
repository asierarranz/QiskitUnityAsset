# Qiskit Unity Asset

In this repository you will find all you need to connect your Unity creations with Qiskit.
It includes a Flask Python service that allows you to send QASM code to your self-hosted Qiskit Server.

Soon we will be providing a public Qiskit server where you will be able to send your QASM requests.

This Unity Asset and Python Flask Server has been created during the Qiskit Camp hackathons of Vermont and Madrid.
