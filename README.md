# Qiskit Unity Asset

In this repository you will find all you need to connect your Unity creations with Qiskit.
It includes a Flask Python service that allows you to send QASM code to your self-hosted Qiskit Server.

Soon we will be providing a public Qiskit server where you will be able to send your QASM requests.
